# Hazard Microservice (ccte-api-hazard)

## Overview
The ccte-api-hazard is a RESTful API designed to manage and provide hazard data. It interacts with a database and offers various endpoints for hazard-related operations.

## Available Data
Data underlying the Hazard API comes from the Toxicity Value Database (ToxValDB). This resource is a compilation of information sourced from multiple public datasets, databases and open literature and includes data on thousands of chemicals from tens of thousands of records, with an emphasis on quantitative estimates of relevant points-of-departure from in vivo toxicology studies, such as no- and low-observable adverse effect levels, screening levels, reference doses, tolerable daily intake, etc.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Programming language used for the development of the application.
- **Spring Boot**: Framework used to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Part of the Spring Data family, used to simplify data access and persistence.
- **Maven**: Build automation tool used for managing project dependencies and build lifecycle.
- **Swagger/OpenAPI**: Used for API documentation and testing.

## Configuration
The application configuration is managed through properties files. The main configuration file is `application.properties`, and environment-specific configurations can be added as needed.
