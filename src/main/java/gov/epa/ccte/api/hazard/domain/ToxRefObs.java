Given ToxRefDB curations are guideline studies with specific testing requirements, guideline profiles are used to populate a list of observations that should be reported and tested within the study, i.e. endpoint observation status. Endpoint Observation status enables automated distinction of true negatives (i.e. tested with no effect observed) and better understanding of false negative (i.e. missing) effects.")

Excludes developmental and neurological studies.; SUB (subchronic): Dose period is typically 13 weeks, but may be as long as 6 months. Excludes developmental and neurological studies.; CHR (chronic): Dose period is typically 12, 18, or 24 months (generally any dosing lasting a year or longer). Excludes developmental and neurological studies.; DEV (developmental): Gestational (in utero) dose period. Sacrificed prior to delivery.; MGR (multigenerational reproductive): Dose period begins in adolescent F0 males and females and continues until terminal generation. At least some of the litters deliver their pups, some may be sacrificed prior to delivery.; NEU (neurological): Study contains functional observation battery or other battery of behavioral testing that occurs during or after dosing. Pathology has specific interest in the brain (i.e. regions, morphology, biochemistry, et cetera). excludes developmental studies; DNT (developmental neurotoxicity): dose period occurs anytime during development (i.e. in utero, lactational, adolescent [after weaning, before adulthood]). Study contains functional observation battery or other battery of behavioral testing that occurs during or after dosing, typically during adulthood.
