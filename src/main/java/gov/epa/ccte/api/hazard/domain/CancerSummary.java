@Schema(description = "A carcinogen is a substance that may cause cancer and pose a health hazard. Carcinogens are subject to specific controls and regulations. National and international health agencies evaluate new and existing chemicals to determine if they are likely to be carcinogens through a process called cancer hazard identification. This process combines human and animal data with supporting evidence to characterize the weight-of-evidence (WOE) regarding the agent's potential as a human carcinogen. The general categories recognized by the guidelines are carcinogenic to humans, likely to be carcinogenic to humans, and suggestive evidence of carcinogenic potential. This endpoint provides summary-level cancer data associated to a chemical.")
